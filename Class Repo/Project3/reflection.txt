When changing the form, the most important things I changed was hiding the password, changing the form tag to POST as DELETE isn't an approved form tag and GET isn't as secure, and adding some input validation. Going through the list I made everything required except for the message, so that it wouldn't submit without username/password/age/email. I also created a 25 character password limit as any more might be a lot, and a 8 character minimum as anything less than that would be insecure. I limited the age field to numbers only and minimum 1 maximum 99. I assigned the email as an email type so it wouldn't accept anything that wasn't an email. Finally, I added placeholders just to give the user extra information on what to input.

 If this were a live production form I might do some more research on securely storing this information since I would actually have a server to work with. I'd also spend more time working with the visuals of everything. I think this project was a great practice and learning experience on form validation and why we create certain standards -- a lot of what was covered I have never thought about when I'm on regular websites every day and it really opened my eyes to a lot.
